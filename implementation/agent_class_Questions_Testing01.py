FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: Sipuleucel-T, also known as Provenge, is the first therapeutic cancer vaccine approved by the FDA. Its significance lies in introducing a new class of treatment that enhances patient survival with minimal side effects by activating a targeted immune response against cancer."
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Question: What is the incremental annual budget impact of adopting enzalutamide for chemotherapy-na√Øve mCRPC patients in a population of 115?"
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: The annual budget impact is $510,641."
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Question: What are the next steps suggested to enhance the clinical benefits of newly FDA-approved immunotherapy agents for metastatic prostate cancer and melanoma?"
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: The suggested next steps include developing immune-monitoring techniques, establishing clinical endpoint assessment guidelines, and exploring combination therapies to enhance benefits."
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Question: What treatment categories show promise in advanced prostate cancer, and which practice yields the best outcomes?"
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: Promising treatments include bone-building therapies, hormonal treatments, and immunotherapies. The best outcomes are achieved through sequential use of these therapies."
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Question: What are the primary and secondary outcomes of early taxane-based chemohormonal therapy added to ADT in treating newly diagnosed, metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer?"
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: The primary outcome shows that early taxane-based chemohormonal therapy likely reduces mortality when added to ADT, with a possible increase in severe side effects. Secondary outcomes suggest reduced risks of prostate cancer-specific death and progression."
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Question: Which immune checkpoint inhibitor shows promise for prostate cancer therapy, and what is its current testing phase?"
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: Ipilimumab shows promise and is currently in phase III trials for prostate cancer."
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Question: What was the primary clinical outcome demonstrated by sipuleucel-T in the integrated analysis of trials D9901 and D9902A among advanced prostate cancer patients?"
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: The primary outcome was a 33% reduction in the risk of death."
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Question: What is the significance of the FDA approval of sipuleucel-T in the context of cancer treatment?"
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: The FDA approval is significant as it marks the first antigen-specific immunotherapy approved for cancer, representing a breakthrough in prostate cancer immunotherapy."
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Question: What was the primary endpoint of the phase 3 trial assessing the efficacy of sipuleucel-T in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, and how was it analyzed?"
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: The primary endpoint was overall survival, analyzed using a stratified Cox regression model adjusted for baseline PSA and lactate dehydrogenase levels."
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Question: What are the two licensed cancer-preventive vaccines mentioned, and which types of cancer do they target?"
FSL_EXAMPLES = FSL_EXAMPLES +   "Answer: The vaccines are anti-HBV, targeting hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma, and anti-HPV, targeting HPV-related cervical carcinoma."
